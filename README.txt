Running the code: Interpret and run the code by simply typing "make" at the command line. This will execute the program 
using the stanford.txt document. The code can also be run with a different input file by typing the command "python 
main.py input_file.txt"

Dependencies: Make sure "main.py", "makefile", and "stanford.txt" are all in the same directory when typing the command 
"make"

Other notes: I have saved the report both as a word document and as a text file. When run with the Notre Dame input file, 
my code takes approximately 50 seconds to run. When run with the Stanford input file, my code takes approximately 1 minute 
and 40 seconds to run
