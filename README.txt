Running the code: Interpret and run the code by simply typing "make" at the command line. This will execute the program 
using the input.txt document, sourceNode A and k = 6 all by default. The code can also be run with a different input file 
and/or sourceNode and/or k by typing the command "python main.py input_file.txt sourceNode k" with custom values for the 
last 3 parameters. 

Dependencies: Make sure "main.py", "makefile", and "input.txt" are all in the same directory when typing the command "make"
(note: "input.txt" could be any input_file.txt).
